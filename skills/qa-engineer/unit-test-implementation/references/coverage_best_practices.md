# Coverage Best Practices

## Coverage Targets
- Overall: >80%
- Critical modules: >90%
- New code: >80%

## Interpreting Reports
- Red/uncovered lines: Need tests
- Yellow/partial branches: Need edge case tests
- Green/covered: Tested

## Coverage ≠ Quality
Focus on testing behavior, not just lines executed.

See SKILL.md for detailed guidance.
